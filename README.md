# Now (WIP)
A nifty li'l application that aspires to help you with hanging information/thoughts you'd like to re-visit

# Goal
The biggest drive behind building this was to explore and learn several techologies, that greatly simplify
an application design, development, deployment and maintenance
- **React (hooks, contexts, etc..)** development with superpowerful constructs
- **Next** SSR - Quick. First. Load.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling of the UI
- **Now CLI** for a very modern and capable deployment flow and app hosting experience while development
- **Firebase** for real-time data storage/availability

# Take a Note
The app currently just works in development with your own firebase configs
